To receive all points, the written report presents a cohesive written analysis that:
•	Summarizes the analysis (5 points)
•	Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations (10 points)
•	Looking over the data we were able to find many different aspects and facts regarding school testing. However, to be able to draw conclusions from the data we had to format the data in a more direct way. First we did the district summary where we calculated, number of students, unique school, total budget, average math and reading scores, % of students above 70% for math and reading, and thus creating our data set. Once we viewed the distract data we broke down the schooling data by looking at things such as, school budget, total student count, if the school was a charter or a district, and the grades of math/reading. We then conducted analysis on top/bottom performing schools, schools by spending, scores by grade, and scores by school types and grades. After completing the analysis we were able to draw the following conclusions and comparisons:
1.	Looking at the data we can see that the larger schools performed worse in all categories (average math and reading, overall math and reading, and passing math and reading %). The larger schools were 58% passing while Medium was 90 and Small were 89.9. 
2.	We can also draw the conclusion that as an overall data set charter schools preform much better in all categories (average math and reading, overall math and reading, and passing math and reading %) than district schools. Overall passing % was 90 for charter and district was 53.
